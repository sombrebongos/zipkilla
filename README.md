# ZIPKILLA

**ZipKilla** is a simple command-line tool designed to perform a dictionary-based brute force attack on password-protected .zip files.
It attempts to extract the contents of the archive by trying each password from a given wordlist file.

This tool is intended for educational and ethical use only â€” for example, recovering forgotten passwords from your own .zip archives.

### Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sombrebongos/zipkilla
$ cd zipkilla
$ bash zip.sh
